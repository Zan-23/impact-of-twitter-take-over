# Impact of Twitter take over by Elon Musk on its users

In this project we will be analyzing the impact of Elon Musk's take over of Twitter on its users. 
We will be using the Twitter API to collect tweets and analyze them using the Natural Language Processing.


## Data Collection
For downloading the data (tweets) you should run the file `main.py` and specify how many tweets you want to download and 
from which date you want to start downloading the tweets. The downloaded tweets will be saved in a ".csv" file in the 
data folder.
